# Transaction Table App

This is a simple transaction table application built as a part of my bootcamp task. It allows you to view and sort transactions based on two criteria: **Price** and **Date**. Additionally, the app has a search functionality to quickly find specific transactions. It simulates a real-time API and database using **Axios** and **live server**.

## Features

- **Sort by Price or Date**: You can sort the transactions either by price or by date.
- **Search Functionality**: Quickly search through transactions to find specific records.
- **Simulated Real-Time API**: The app uses **Axios** to fetch transaction data from a simulated database via **live server**.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Basic structure and styling.
- **Axios**: To handle HTTP requests and simulate API interaction.
- **Live Server**: Used to simulate a real-time API and serve the app locally.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/transaction-table-app.git
   ```
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd transaction-table-app
   ```

3. Open the app using **live server**:
   - If you don't have **live server** installed, you can get it as a VS Code extension or use another method to serve files locally.

4. Open the browser and interact with the transaction table by sorting and searching.
